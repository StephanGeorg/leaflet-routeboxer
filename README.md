# Leaflet RouteBoxer

This is a Leaflet implementation of the [RouteBoxer](http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/routeboxer/docs/examples.html) Class from Google.

The RouteBoxer class generates a set of L.LatLngBounds objects that are guaranteed
to cover every point within a specified distance of a path, such as that generated
for a route by an OSRM directions service.
